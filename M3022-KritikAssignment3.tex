\begin{question}
    Integral domains are an abstraction of which two fundamental rings that we have already studied?
\end{question}

The ring of integers is one of the most important rings that we have studied so far. The rational numbers are also an important ring that we have studied so far.

\begin{question}
    What are the various types of integral domains defined in this section?
\end{question}

We have types of integral domains such as \emph{unique factorization domain} (UFD), \emph{principal ideal domains} (PID), and \emph{Euclidean domains}.

\begin{question}
    The field of fractions of a ring abstracts what idea from basic mathematics?
\end{question}

The field of fractions of a ring abstracts from the idea of adding and multiplying integers.
