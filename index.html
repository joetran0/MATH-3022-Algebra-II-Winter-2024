        <h1>MATH 3022 Algebra II Winter 2024</h1>

        <h2>Overview of MATH 3022 Algebra II</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This is the second introductory course on the structures of Algebra, embracing Groups, Rings and Fields and other algebraic topics. The focus of this course is Ring Theory and Fields. We will study the general concepts of rings: homomorphisms, ideals, integral domains, fields, and vector spaces. This general theory is studied hand-in-hand with different types of rings in detail, e.g. commutative rings, rings with identities, integral domains, division rings, and fields.</p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

        SC/MATH 3021 3.00 or permission of the course coordinator.

        <h3>Credit Exclusion</h3>

        SC/MATH 3020 6.00, GL/MATH 3650 6.00, GL/MODR 3650 3.00, GL/MATH 3515 3.00

        <h3>Textbook/Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Course Textbook: Judson T. W., Abstract Algebra (2022 Edition) <a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/download.html">Free electronic edition</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Covered Textbook Material</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 16: Rings</li>
            <li>Chapter 17: Polynomials</li>
            <li>Chapter 18: Integral Domains</li>
            <li>Chapter 20: Vector Spaces</li>
            <li>Chapter 21: Fields</li>
            <li>Chapter 22: Finite Fields</li>
            <li>Chapter 23: Galois Theory</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Format</h2>

        <p>Starting Monday, January 8, in-person lectures will be given at 9:30-10:30 AM every Monday (ACW 306), Wednesday (ACW 304), and Friday (ACW 303)</p>

        <h2>Real Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>This is a theoretical, proof-based course. Familiarity with concepts from linear algebra is helpful, but it is not enough to follow this course effectively. Proficiency in carrying out methods of proof and fluency in handling set notation and operations (writing proofs by induction and contradiction and working with abstract objects and collections of sets) is essential. A good grasp of MATH 1200 Problems, Conjectures, and Proofs and MATH 3021 Algebra I is an asset for assimilating the material of this course.</p>

        <h2>Assignments and Score</h2>

        <h3>Homework Assignments (25% of total score)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>During the semester, four homework assignments will be posted on eClass. Each homework assignment will have questions added continuously with the last question added one week before it is due. Each assignment must be submitted in-person at the beginning of class. Each assignment is worth 5% of the total score. The due dates are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>February 2, 2024</li>
                    <li>March 1, 2024</li>
                    <li>March 22, 2024</li>
                    <li>April 8, 2024</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Following with the course material is important in this course. For each chapter, there will be three questions from the Reading Questions in Kritik. You will be asked to evaluate three other classmates. Kritik will be worth 5% of the total score.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Academic honestly in homework submissions</h4>

        <p>You are allowed to discuss your work on the homework assignments with your classmates. However, the submitted solutions to these assignments must be in your own words. Submitting common solutions with only notational variation or sentence-for-sentence paraphrasing is considered cheating. Furthermore, consulting solutions from third-party sites, such as Chegg, is not allowed. A safe approach is first to discuss the problems and their solutions with your classmates and then write your submission separately without consulting each other's notes. Breach of academic honesty will be reported and handled according to the policy of the University.</p>

        <h3>Two In-Class Tests (30% of total score)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Test 1 will be given on February 9. It will be a written exam given during regular class time and location that can only be written in person.</li>
            <li>Test 2 will be given on March 8. It will be a written exam given during regular class time and location that can only be written in person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Exam (45% of total score)</h3>

        <p>A cumulative final exam will be given during the final examination period. It will be a three-hour written exam that can only be taken in-person.</p>

        <h3>Late or Missed Assignments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You will be allowed up to two late submissions of the assignments, without giving reasons.   Late submissions are due at the start of the next lecture after the due date.   (For the last assignment, late submission is due at 9:30 a.m. on April 11.)</li>
            <li>You need provide legitimate reasons for missed work asap.  Examples of legitimate reasons include prolonged and serious sickness, personal/family emergency, religious observance.</li>
            <li>I will start adding questions to an assignment about three weeks prior to the due date and all questions will be posted at least one week prior the due date, so being sick for the couple of days before the due date does not count as legitimate reason for missing the assignment.</li>
            <li>Contact me asap if you miss work with legitimate reasons.  I will ask you to complete the work without grades and then transfer the weight of the missed work to the final exam.</li>
            <li>Upon missing more than one assessment, you are required to meet with the instructor and present a plan to catch up with the work.</li>
            <li>For missed final examination, students need to submit the Deferred Standing Agreement Form, no later than one week after the examination.   Upon approval of deferred standing, the student will write the final exam at the Common Deferred Examination scheduled by the department. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Letter Grade</h3>

        <p>The final score will be calculated based on homework assignments (30%), the midterm exam (30%), and the final exam (40%). Your letter grade will then be assigned based on the standard York University undergraduate grading scheme: 90.00%-100.00% A+, 80.00%-89.99% A, 75.00%-79.99% B+, 70.00%-74.99% B, 65.00%-69.99% C+, 60.00%-64.99% C, 55.00%-59.99% D+, 50.00%-54.99% D, 40.00%-49.99% E, 0-39.99% F.</p>
